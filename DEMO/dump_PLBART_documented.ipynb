    "# Reinforcement Learning Chess\n",
    "Hi there! If you're interested in learning about reinforcement learning, you are in the right place. As we all know the best way to learn about a topic is to build something and make a kernel about it. My plan is to make a series of notebooks where I work may way towards a full-fledged chess AI named RLC (Reinforcement Learning Chess). \n",
    "\n",
    "Tackling chess is a big challenge, mainly because of its huge state-space. Therefore I start with simpler forms of chess and solve these problems with elementary RL-techniques. Gradually I will expand this untill we end up in a chess AI that can play actual games of chess somewhat intelligibly. The forms of chess I want to cover in my notebooks are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Move Chess \n",
    "- Goal: Learn to find the shortest path between 2 squares on a chess board  \n",
    "- Motivation: Move Chess has a small statespace, which allows us to tackle this with simple RL algorithms.\n",
    "- Concepts: Dynamic Programming, Policy Evaluation, Policy Improvement, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, Synchronous & Asynchronous back-ups, Monte Carlo (MC) Prediction, MC Control, Temporal Difference (TD) Learning, TD control, TD-lambda, SARSA(-max)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Capture Chess\n",
    "- Goal: Capture as many pieces from the opponent within n fullmoves\n",
    "- Motivation: Piece captures happen more frequently than win-lose-draw events. This give the algorithm more information to learn from.\n",
    "- Concepts: Q-learning, value function approximation, experience replay, fixed-q-targets, policy gradients, REINFORCE, actor-critic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Real Chess (a.k.a. chess)\n",
    "- Goal: Play chess competitively against a human beginner\n",
    "- Motivation: A RL chess AI\n",
    "- Concepts: Monte Carlo Tree Search\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other notebooks\n",
    "[**Notebook 2: Model free learning**](https://www.kaggle.com/arjanso/reinforcement-learning-chess-2-model-free-methods)  \n",
    "[**Notebook 3: Q-networks**](https://www.kaggle.com/arjanso/reinforcement-learning-chess-3-q-networks)  \n",
    "[**Notebook 4: Policy Gradients**](https://www.kaggle.com/arjanso/reinforcement-learning-chess-4-policy-gradients)  \n",
    "[**Notebook 5: Monte Carlo Tree Search**](https://www.kaggle.com/arjanso/reinforcement-learning-chess-5-tree-search)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In my notebooks, I will describe and reference the Reinforcement Learning theory but I will not fully explain it. For that there are resources available that do a match better job at explaining RL than I could. For that my advice would be to check out David Silver's (Deepmind) lectures that are available on Youtube and the book Introduction to Reinforcement Learning by Sutton and Barto referenced below."
